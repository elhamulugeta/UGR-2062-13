    <p class = "paragraph1"> One of our most favorite activities when in any city is visiting their museums. This is because  museums can be an excellent
        way to glimpse into the culture, history and style of any place. Addis Ababa is a city overflowing with history and culture, and these are some of our favorite museums to visit, with company, or by yourself!
    </p>


<ul>

        <li> Red Terror Museum </li>
        <p> We start our list with a very sad part of Ethiopian History, which occured during the <span style = "font-style: italic;"> Derg</span> regime.
        The <span style = "font-style: italic;"> Derg</span> regime is known for being an authoritarian government, and the Red Terror is a dark time in Ethiopian history when 
    the government killed anyone who dared to oppose him. Swing by at this museum to learn more, and for a look into a sad history. </p>
        <li> National Museum of Ethiopia </li>
        <p> Proudly displaying one of the first ever humans to be dicovered, Lucy, this museum definitely has an awe-inspiring factor to it from the very start.
            From ancient relics of various Ethiopian kings(and queens!) to a very wide range of cultural and historical objects, this museum will leave you feeling in awe of all the history this amazing city has to offer.
        </p>
        <li> Unity Park Museum </li>
        <p> This park, located in 4 kilo, is nothing short of an entire city by itself! In addition to the restaurants and various
            other entertainment it has to offer, this park also has a very well-built and amazing museum. Inside this museum, you will not only 
            find the statue of one of the most popular ruler of Ethiopia, Menilik the Second, but also many of his possessions as well. There are tributes to 
            various other rulers as well. This museum is truly a great way to introduce yourself to Ethiopian and Addis Ababan culture!
