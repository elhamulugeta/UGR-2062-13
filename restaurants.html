<li>Kategna traditional restaurant </li>

<p>Serving many dishes from a single platter, friends, families, and communities come together to share the array of meats, stews, and vegetables that are carefully spread out on a slab of injera.
     Using their hands, each person tears a piece off from the edges, scooping up whatever stew or piece of meat is nearby. Could be Doro Wot, with its spiced butter and savory thickness. Or Misir Wot, with its tender, earthy lentils. Or, ahhhh, Sega Wot, with its rich, saucy pieces of beef.
     This registrant can never disappoint! </p>
